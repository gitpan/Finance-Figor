Finance::Figor version 1.0

Instantiations of this module assist with automated management of one's
finances, collecting data on a regular basis, comparing current balances to
those of a month previously, and emailing the results to the user.

The usual setup is to run Finance::Figor on a daily basis, which over time
collects enough data to show trends, using a graph to overlay the data from the
current month with that of the previous month. Major financial events, such as
paychecks and rent/mortgage/car payements, tend to occur at the same point each
month, so it is often more useful to look at the "delta" of the current balances
versus those of a month ago, which is a better representation of the amount of
discretionary spending available.

This tight feedback loop allows the user to quickly correct aberrant spending
habits, or to spend more freely, knowing that their available discretionary
spending is above average. It also can help the user -- as in the case of this
author, within one day of it happening -- detect fraudulent usage of one's bank
accounts.
